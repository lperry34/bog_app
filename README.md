# README

This went very well for me. The first time through I was about to pull my hair out due to nothing working, and an outdated solution branch. By the end I was able to complete it in 10 minutes and 6 seconds (without css... I was trying to test myself) and it felt pretty good. Before this I never really new how to actually set up a full crud rails app, and now I do.


## Tips
* Stay calm... you aren't going to die

* repetition makes perfect

* Have fun with it. By the end it felt like a game

* Be a boss
